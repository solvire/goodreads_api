# goodreads_api
A Goodreads API Command Line Tool

## Utility or Appliance 

Simply interface with goodreads over the command line. There is nothing special going on here. I just needed this for a few items of housekeeping.  My intention was to use it to push in my reviews from my account on Audible.com and also to learn how to use [CookieCutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and [docopt-php](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.php). 

## Other Libs

It looks like most of the other libs out there are pretty incomplete.  I know why too after working with the API. I'm going to try to complete a few more calls.  If anyone is interested please go ahead and fork this.
