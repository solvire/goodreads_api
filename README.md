# goodreads_api
A Goodreads API Command Line Tool

## Utility or Appliance 

Simply interface with goodreads over the command line. There is nothing special going on here. I just needed this for a few items of housekeeping.  My intention was to use it to push in my reviews from my account on Audible.com and also to learn how to use [CookieCutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and [docopt-php](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.php).
